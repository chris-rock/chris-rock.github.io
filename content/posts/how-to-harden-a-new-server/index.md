Deutsche Telekom developed scripts in Chef and Puppet to harden servers according to well-known guidelines like bettercrypto and internal guidelines at Deutsche Telekom. More information is available at the project page of the [Hardening Framework](http://hardening.io/). Disclosure: I am core developer at this project.

Today we cook with [knife-solo](http://matschaffer.github.io/knife-solo/) and harden a fresh copy of Ubuntu 14.04. The process of hardening a server is quite difficult and takes a lot of knowledge and experience. Even the most-experienced administrators rely on guidelines to meet the best practices.

Since we live in a cloud world by now, [Dominik Richter](http://arlimus.github.io/), Patrick Meier and myself invented the `Hardening Framework`. It is a set of cookbooks that help you to secure your server with well-known rules. 

The following steps illustrate the hardening process of a fresh server with nothing than a base Linux system.

I assume you have [Chef Development Kit](http://www.getchef.com/downloads/chef-dk/mac/) or [Chef](http://www.getchef.com/chef/install/) and [Berkshelf](http://berkshelf.com/) on your machine.

At first of all we need to install `knife-solo` via `gem` on your workstation.


```bash
∅> sudo gem install knife-solo

Thanks for installing knife-solo!

If you run into any issues please let us know at:
  https://github.com/matschaffer/knife-solo/issues

If you are upgrading knife-solo please uninstall any old versions by
running `gem clean knife-solo` to avoid any errors.

See http://bit.ly/CHEF-3255 for more information on the knife bug
that causes this.

As a next step we need to download the `hardening-kitchen`. This comes with a set of hardening cookbooks and works out of the box. You're free to extend the kitchen with your own cookbooks.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TelekomLabs/example-chef-hardening.git
cd example-chef-hardening
```

By now, the workstation is ready and we are able to bootstrap our server with Chef and our hardening cookbooks.

```bash
knife solo bootstrap ubuntu@hardening.tlabscloud.com nodes/default.json

In less than 5 minutes, a new server is hardened for the core system and ssh. Be aware that your server still needs some configuration in order to be production ready. For that I recommend to:

 * Configure  your firewall properly
 * Install  critical patches
 * Use patch management
 * Use system monitoring

Happy Hardening!
