          <section class="content"><p>To ensure the security of your <span class="caps">IT</span> services, different disciplines need to come together. Development, operations and security departments need to work hand in hand in order to ship a secure product. Every department has its core competencies and it is a challenge to create a common view on the security implementation for a&nbsp;product.</p>
<h2 id="the-challenge">The&nbsp;challenge</h2>
<p>The separation of knowledge between departments has its advantages but comes with some disadvantages. Quite often, the separation leads to an environment where different departments have different&nbsp;goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>dev teams are under pressure to ship the&nbsp;product</li>
<li>ops teams need to ensure everything runs&nbsp;smoothly</li>
<li>security teams have to ensure that the new product is&nbsp;secure</li>
</ul>
<p>Since extensive technical know-how is required to ship a product (and even more is required to ship a successful product), every party needs to understand and breath the whole product delivery process and every aspect of the implementation need to be well known. On top of that, each department has to deal with different&nbsp;artifacts:</p>
<ul>
<li>source code&nbsp;(developers)</li>
<li>packages <span class="amp">&amp;</span> runtime&nbsp;(ops)</li>
<li>regularities, pen-tests&nbsp;(security)</li>
</ul>
<p>In a static world, this would not be an issue, but since the velocity of technology increases, the shipment of each artifacts need to synchronized in order to ship a product in time. The question is, how departments are able deliver a product together by focusing on their core&nbsp;competency?</p>
<h2 id="find-the-same-language">Find the same&nbsp;language</h2>
<p>About two years ago, we faced the challenge mentioned above and it got us thinking? From our perspective, the current delivery process was broken. Would there be a better approach? Could we use new technologies to speed up the development and time-to-market, as well as help departments to work more effectively&nbsp;together?</p>
<p>We identified a few&nbsp;patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security teams need a way to describe their rules without the need of extensive programming&nbsp;skills</li>
<li>Developers need an automated way to deal with security&nbsp;configuration</li>
<li>Operations need a deterministic and manageable&nbsp;software</li>
</ul>
<p>In a small team of four (<a href="http://arlimus.github.io/">Dominik</a>, Patrick, <a href="http://ehaselwanter.com/">Edmund</a> and I) worked in an interdisciplinary team with know-how in each area for product delivery and security. We started prototyping, developing, deploying. Eventually, we created a project called <a href="http://dev-sec.io/">DevSec Hardening Framework</a> with Deutsche Telekom. What is special about the Hardening&nbsp;Framework?</p>
<ul>
<li>Security configuration is documented as code which is great for developers, because they are able to focus on product&nbsp;implementation</li>
<li>Instead of abstract regularities, we used Serverspec to define tests. This allowed use the tests as a verification&nbsp;mechanism</li>
<li>All security requirements are automated via a configuration management&nbsp;tool</li>
<li>The implementation is completely deterministic which is essential for&nbsp;operations</li>
<li>Security is implemented by&nbsp;design</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, we developed the security test rules first&nbsp;(like):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dev-sec/tests-os-hardening">https://github.com/dev-sec/tests-os-hardening</a></li>
</ul>
<p>From now on, security teams started developing tests instead of static documents, because those can be re-used across the whole company. E.g. those can be integrated in <span class="caps">CI</span> environments or used on local test&nbsp;machines.</p>
<p>Next, development and operations needed an implementation that automatically remedies failed tests. We implemented the security configuration in Chef, Puppet and&nbsp;Ansible:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dev-sec/chef-os-hardening">https://github.com/dev-sec/chef-os-hardening</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dev-sec/puppet-os-hardening">https://github.com/dev-sec/puppet-os-hardening</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dev-sec/ansible-os-hardening">https://github.com/dev-sec/ansible-os-hardening</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All implementations of the os-hardening module use the same tests. By writing all security requirements as tests rules, we are able to automate tests and increase the velocity of the product delivery. Think of a manufacturing line that has security&nbsp;built-in.</p>
<h2 id="take-away">Take-Away</h2>
<p>It is essential to address the need of each department to ship a successful product. DevOps tools help companies to align development and operations teams. By defining the common set as regulatory rules, all departments find a way to collaborate more efficiently together and are able integrate security tests into the normal product development&nbsp;workflow.</p>
